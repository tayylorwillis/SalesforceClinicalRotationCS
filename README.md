# SalesforceClinicalRotationCS
System to match students with their preceptors at AHEC

## Instructions for group members and other viewers
### Make sure Java is installed
Latest version [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk23-linux)
<br>*If necessary, [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html) are instructions for setting or changing the PATH system variable*

### Install repo locally
I *HIGHLY* recommend using [IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) as your IDE for this, as it makes committing/pushing much simpler.
1. Go to the [main page](https://github.com/tayylorwillis/SalesforceClinicalRotationCS) of this repository and click on the green 'code' button.
2. Copy the HTTPS url

3. Open your IDE (I'm using IDEA) and you may have the option to clone a repository as one of your creation option. Click that.
4. Enter the URL. If you do not have git installed, as seen in the screenshot, simply download and install.
