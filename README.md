# Matching Algorithm to Connect Preceptors with Medical Students

## Project Overview
Medical students in underserved and rural communities are often 
unable to connect with preceptors from the medical community due to 
restrictions imposed by their geographical location. As a consequence, 
these students are often denied the same mentorship opportunities
as their peers. AHEC (Area Health Education Center) aims to create more successful and meaningful
mentorships for students from underserved and rural communities. 
Our goal is to provide AHEC with a service that utilizes a specially
designed algorithm to compare responses from medical students and 
preceptors to find the optimal match for a mentor team.
