# SalesforceClinicalRotationCS
System to match students with their preceptors at AHEC

## Instructions for group members and other viewers
### Make sure Java is installed
Latest version [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk23-linux)
<br>*If necessary, [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html) are instructions for setting or changing the PATH system variable*

### Install repo locally
I *HIGHLY* recommend using [IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) as your IDE for this, as it makes committing/pushing much simpler.
1. Go to the [main page](https://github.com/tayylorwillis/SalesforceClinicalRotationCS) of this repository and click on the green 'code' button.
2. Copy the HTTPS url
![Step 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1bf3bc4-84a3-4f2d-9f87-9a6f8eb2989f)
3. Open your IDE (I'm using IDEA) and you may have the option to clone a repository as one of your creation option. Click that.
4. Enter the URL. If you do not have git installed, as seen in the screenshot, simply download and install.

## Git intstructions (in IDEA)
1. When working on any file, right click it and create a new branch
![Step 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da96f87e-fa9c-43ac-bb94-3dad49dd2bd7)
2. When creating, make sure checkout branch is selected so you ensure you're working on this new branch.
3. Make sure to commit at most of your steps (locally) in case you make an error and need to rollback to a previous version.
![Step 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15efbc39-c105-43c3-bc43-97be3bf35c23)
4. If you are making a change that you want to commit to the remote repo, hit commit and push.
5. In Github, you can now see your branch, and other members will be notified of the changes within your branch.
![Step 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b9ee3e8-0dab-4103-9e81-c87dbb296b03)
6. On the main page, we can now go ahead and create a pull request.

<br>Otherwise, name the branch something relevant to the change you plan to push on it!*
