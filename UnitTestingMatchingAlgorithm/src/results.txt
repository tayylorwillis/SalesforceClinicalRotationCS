Notes:
 - Utilized lots of debugging statements in each test, and kept them for clarity
 - Attempted to recreate fields from the DB in classes instead

Test 1: Threshold Filtering

--- Starting Threshold Filtering Test ---

Calculating similarity between 'Nursing' and 'Medicine'
Similarity result: 25.0%
High threshold matches: 1
  PR001 (Dr. Perfect Match): 98.0%
Low threshold matches: 3
  PR001 (Dr. Perfect Match): 98.0%
  PR002 (Dr. Good Match): 85.0%
  PR003 (Dr. Poor Match): 45.0%

Checking which preceptors are in each list:
High threshold contains PR001: true
High threshold contains PR002: false
High threshold contains PR003: false
Low threshold contains PR001: true
Low threshold contains PR002: true
Low threshold contains PR003: true

Final assertions:
Checking if poor match (PR003) is in low threshold results: true
Checking if low threshold includes all preceptors. Found: 3, Expected: at least 3
